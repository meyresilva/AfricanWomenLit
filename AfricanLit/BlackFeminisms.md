## Black Feminisms, Transnational Feminism

In Pedagogies of Crossing, M. Jacqui Alexander remarks
that the idea of a Global Feminism, a transnational feminism or the feminism of the majority, often blurs categories of race, culture, and sexuality. She declares that these discourses have been filled with binaries such as oppressor-oppressed. These feminist approaches explain Third World women’s oppressions in terms of their relation to traditional practices, and they propose feminism as a way to save women from their own patriarchal traditions. Alexander warns of the dangers of subsuming the local into the
global through applying the Western experience to the rest of the world. Certainly, if an ideal global feminism puts all women in one box in order to examine how they are oppressed by nature and culture, these women then become victims to be saved from their own backwardness, ignorance.1 Jacqui Alexander’s work aligns with Chandra Mohanty’s in advising us on how to conduct our practices from the perspective by which local and global interests might converge and diverge, since categories of race, class, gender, and sexuality are differently nuanced in different locations. 


In Africa, the definition of feminism has undergone many interpretations and
nuances. The Ghanaian writer Ama Ata Aidoo envisages a feminist movement that would seek justice not only for African women but for all African people, suggesting an inclusive movement that could integrate all people into the construction of the continent.

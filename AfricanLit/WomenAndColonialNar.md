## Gender and Colonial Narratives

<p> 
During the nineteenth century sexuality and race functioned as prominent markers
of Otherness, setting parameters for what was normal and acceptable and what must be
regulated and brought into normality. In 1898 Joseph Conrad published <i>Heart of
Darkness</i>, a novel that would become a landmark for colonial studies. The novel emerged
from Conrad’s travels to what was the Belgian colony, Congo, which served as his main
inspiration. Though the novel has been acknowledged as a critique of King Leopold’s
abuses in Africa, Conrad also portrays a darkness of the continent and an African people
deprived of humanity, as the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe remarked almost sixty years
later(Achebe 1977). </p>

To understand how these literary works undo stereotypes and reconstruct female subjectivity, it is crucial to see these narratives as a looking
glass where writers come to terms with their fragmented identities while giving their community tools to reinterpret women's experiences through
other lenses. </p>

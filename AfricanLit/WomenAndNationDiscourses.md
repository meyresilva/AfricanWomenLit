##  Women and Nationalist Discourses

In addition to colonial discourses, nationalist narratives also constructed female
Otherness in various other ways. The first generation of African writers, who were predominantly male, produced stereotypical discourses concerning women’s sexuality. For instance, in Achebe’s Things Fall Apart (1959), women may function as objects to be traded by fathers and husbands who have ownership of female bodies. Often portrayed as empty vessels, lacking any desire, in Achebe’s novel, women are “excluded from the political, economic, the judicial, and even the discourse of the community life” (Stratton, 25). Achebe’s depictions of pre-colonial Nigeria as a place with a very systematic economic and social organization might suggest that women did not have any power in that societal organization. 


Not only did the Nigerian writer misrepresent women’s experiences, but Leopold
Sédar Senghor, Chinua Achebe, Ngugi Wa Thiong’O, and other male writers who invested their energies in restoring African indigenous cultures through their literary narratives also did so. While their nationalist discourses attempted to resist narratives like Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, they replicated the notion that women’s bodies should be appropriated—this time to symbolize idealized new nations. Their nationalist rhetoric frequently utilized women’s bodies as metaphors of the land, and their poems were hymns praising a beloved motherland subjected to patriarchal power. As Bergeron argues, “The nation has often been imagined in terms of metaphors of the family and accordingly has replicated the patriarchy of conventional family forms."

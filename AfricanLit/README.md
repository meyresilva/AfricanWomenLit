## Gender and Cultural Production

During the nineteenth century sexuality and race functioned as prominent markers
of Otherness, setting parameters for what was normal and acceptable and what must be
regulated and brought into normality. In 1898 Joseph Conrad published Heart of
Darkness, a novel that would become a landmark for colonial studies. The novel emerged
from Conrad’s travels to what was the Belgian colony, Congo, which served as his main
inspiration. Though the novel has been acknowledged as a critique of King Leopold’s
abuses in Africa, Conrad also portrays a darkness of the continent and an African people
deprived of humanity, as the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe remarked almost sixty years
later (Achebe 1977).


European cultural texts have historically constructed African sexualities as dirty
and impure. In this sense, Christianity and colonization have linked African female
sexuality to danger, violence, or death, and “to the missions, excessive African sexuality
was to be restrained as a salient element of their ‘civilizing mission’ project” (Becker 37).


In many ways, colonized women’s bodies needed to be under control as they represented
a danger to social order, thus stereotypical images of depraved women have long been
part of Western imagination. In many ways, colonial history has been written on female
bodies that often serve as the metaphor for the conquered land, an untamed space that
must be regulated. Like native lands, female bodies become properties of a patriarchal
colonial system.

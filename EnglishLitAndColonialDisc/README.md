## Women's Texts and *Herstory*

What has been called African women's literature has emerged in universities in Europe and The United States in the late eighties. For me, the experience of studying African Literature, especially African women works started in London. There I had the opportunity to do research at the British Library, take a few courses, including one of creative writing. 

The Creative Writing course was in a black community and the teacher, a Caribbean writer, used to bring to his classes texts by African and Caribbean authors. Thus, the first seeds which would bear fruits few years later began to germinate. Besides the creative writing classes, and the BL, what helped me was living in London, where I made friends, women from different parts of Africa who took care of my hair and told me their stories. During that period, I had already read the works of some African women writers. And I always kept my ears open to all those stories. As a friend, I listened, smiled, and cried; as a researcher, I tried to cross the experiences of those women with the characters in the novels of Ama Ata Aidoo, Mariama Ba, Ken Bugul, Flora Nwapa, Yvonne Vera, Tsitsi Dangarmba, Paulina Chiziane and many other writers.It was in London that I began to forge the idea of studying literary narratives as data to write history or herstory. 


However, an obstacle came in my way. I have studied literature my whole life and intended to use fiction in my research. The heated classroom debates lit my way. I listened with great respect to the diversity of opinions and was confronted several times by some colleagues who defended the dichotomy history/literature, truth/fiction, real/imaginary.

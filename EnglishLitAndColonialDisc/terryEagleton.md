For Terry Eagleton, literature maintains an intrinsic
relationship with issues of social power (Eagleton, 2003:30).
Power to build and manufacture the Other, the different from the self, 
but also to resist and oppose these constructions. If during the 19th century some texts functioned as a vehicle for imperial domination, through the representation of people from the colonies as barbarians or uncivilized; 
from the second half of the 20th century onwards, other
texts could be used as a vehicle for resisting hegemonic ideas. Aim√©e Cesaire, for example, in Discourse on Colonialism, debunks some ideas by saying that barbarie and lack of civilization had started in Europe, spreading into the colonies, gaining force, transforming the new environment into a world without rules.


When the British Empire dominated foreign lands, conquering communities, 
it did not only use military and political force, it also used the 
most diverse texts. In this way, we can say that imperialism 
is also something symbolic, that is, from the sphere of mental representation.



On the one hand, it is obvious that empires were formed through
military force, starting from the destruction of communities and 
their economic systems, in addition to the incessant search for wealth,
on the other, the same empires were established through a less obvious way; 
their hegemony was also imposed via various symbolic and cultural forms.

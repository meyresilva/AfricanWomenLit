## Hayden White's Tropics of Discourse

With the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, a period marked by the
crisis of paradigms, scientists and historians began to lose belief in absolute 
truths, which had legitimized the social order so far. And it has led historians, 
social scientists and literary theorists to dismantle frontiers and think other ways of doing 
research in humanities and social sciences.

Hayden White in Tropics of Discourse argues that many contemporary historians no
longer agree that art and sciences are essentially separate ways of understanding the world. 
> “Today it seems quite clear that the nineteenth-century belief in the radical dissimilarity 
>between art and science resulted from a misunderstanding fostered by the romantic artist's 
fear of science and the positivist scientist's ignorance of art.” (40-41)

In The Order of Things, published in 1966, Foucault challenges the binary
opposition reality/imagination or science/art by doing a lengthy discussion of Las Meninas, a painting by the Spanish painter 
Diego Velazquez. In Las Meninas, Velazquez uses the light to play with complex gazes by 
concealing the most important subject of the painting. In his analysis, 
Foucault develops his central argument: all periods of history
have some fundamental conditions to define what is acceptable as truth in scientific discourses. While some discourses have been considered truthful and valid, others can be taken as witchcraft, magic, or heresy. 


Furthermore, Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse change over time through
general and relative changes in the episteme from one period to another. In his analysis 
of Las Meninas, he is interested in finding another way of looking. For him, the 
painting represents conflicting viewpoints, multiple foci, on the relationship between 
art and reality that involves our own gaze as we put ourselves into the abyss.

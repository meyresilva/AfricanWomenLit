## Women's Bodies in Nationalist Discourses

In addition to colonial discourses, nationalist narratives also constructed female
Otherness in various other ways. The first generation of African writers, 
who were predominantly male, produced stereotypical discourses concerning women’s sexuality. 
For instance, in Achebe’s Things Fall Apart (1959), women may function as objects to be traded 
by fathers and husbands who have ownership of female bodies. Often portrayed as empty vessels, 
lacking any desire, in Achebe’s novel, women are “excluded from the political, economic, 
the judicial, and even the discourse of the community life” (Stratton, 25). Achebe’s depictions
of pre-colonial Nigeria as a place with a very systematic economic and social organization might 
suggest that women did not have any power in that societal organization. 


Not only did the Nigerian writer misrepresent women’s experiences, but Leopold
Sédar Senghor, Chinua Achebe, Ngugi Wa Thiong’O, and other male writers who invested
their energies in restoring African indigenous cultures through their literary narratives
also did so. While their nationalist discourses attempted to resist narratives like Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, 
they replicated the notion that women’s bodies should be appropriated—this time to symbolize idealized new nations. 
Their nationalist rhetoric frequently utilized women’s bodies as metaphors of the land, and their poems were hymns 
praising a beloved motherland subjected to patriarchal power. As Bergeron argues, “The nation has often been imagined 
in terms of metaphors of the family and accordingly has replicated the patriarchy of conventional family forms.
Women are viewed as mothers of the nations, as reproducers rather than producers, as objects of protection rather than agents” (Bergeron 20). 

Though there are a few exceptions, 
nationalist narratives are often created around male heroes who 
defy the colonizers and denounce the abuses of colonial projects in order to become 
national subjects. In these masculine narratives, women might occupy an erotic place or a spiritual 
place, as mothers of the nation or Mother Africa. In these cases, the subjects of the nations are the male heroes.

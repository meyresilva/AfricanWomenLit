## Theoretical Framework

In this section, I will introduce some topics on postcolonial theory, 
gender studies, African Studies and feminist theories by women from the global south
. My goal here is to pave the way, drawing attention to the representations of women's experiences
in African literature. Here, cutting the ground is important to get familiar with terms and specific language.

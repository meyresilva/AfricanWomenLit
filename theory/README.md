## Theoretical Framework

In this section, I will introduce Postcolonial Theory, 
Gender Studies, African Studies and Feminist Theories, drawing attention to the representations of women's experiences
in African literature. By cutting the ground, I intend to explore specific language and terminology, often present in theoretical texts, besides considering 
the main discussions concerning the misrepresentation of women's experiences both in colonialist and nationalist discourses. 

These texts here often present a multi-disciplinary approach, including Humanities and Social 
Sciences, History and Literature, Sociology and Cultural Studies, thus, focusing on women's condition through diverse perspectives.

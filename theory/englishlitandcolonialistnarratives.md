##  The Representation of the *Other* in Literary Narratives


For Terry Eagleton, literature maintains an intrinsic
relationship with issues of social power (Eagleton, 2003:30).
Power to build and manufacture the Other, the different from the self, 
but also to resist and oppose these constructions. If during the 19th century some texts functioned as a vehicle for imperial domination, through the representation of people from the colonies as barbarians or uncivilized; 
from the second half of the 20th century onwards, other
texts could be used as a vehicle for resisting hegemonic ideas. Aimée Cesaire, for example, in Discourse on Colonialism, debunks some ideas by saying that barbarie and lack of civilization had started in Europe, spreading into the colonies, gaining force, transforming the new environment into a world without rules.


When the British Empire dominated foreign lands, conquering communities, 
it did not only use military and political force, it also used the 
most diverse texts. In this way, we can say that imperialism 
is also something symbolic, that is, from the sphere of mental representation.



On the one hand, it is obvious that empires were formed through
military force, starting from the destruction of communities and 
their economic systems, in addition to the incessant search for wealth,
on the other, the same empires were established through a less obvious way; 
their hegemony was also imposed via various symbolic and cultural forms. 


As effectively as oral language, 
literature created channels for the imposition of 
colonialist ideals. Thus, tales, memoirs, novels, adventure stories, 
and poetry forged in the metropolis could be consolidated in the colonies.


However, what we know today as English literature really 
began to emerge in the early 19th century. The era of English 
establishment and the birth of the romantic novel coincide with the 
height of British imperialism. With the novel, a homogeneous and universal subject
is constructed in the discursive field. This imperial genre builds a subject that 
annihilates the Other who does not share the gender, race or class of this universal subject.

In colonial writing, the Other has been seen through the prism of the degenerate, 
indolent, lazy, contributing to the colonizer’s portrayal as intelligent or hard worker. 
Here, the novel, through the unpretentious goal of entertaining, reiterates colonial power,
and from there, the colonialist discourse can be better understood. 
	
Colonialist discourse can be defined as a practice of symbolic events, 
including texts, conventions and implicit meanings that Europe applied during the process of 
colonial expansion, in order to understand the bizarre and unintelligible. And, through this 
discourse, Europe laid bare the Other while guaranteeing its authority (Said, 1993).

In this sense, we can affirm that the study of English Literature in the colonies was above anything else, 
primarily political. The spread of the academic discipline was in the service of nationalism. 
Just as the Monarchy was at the center of the political field, literature occupied the central role in the cultural field.

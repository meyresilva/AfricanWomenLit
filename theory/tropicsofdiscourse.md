## Women's History Through Other Lenses

With the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, a period marked by the
crisis of paradigms, scientists and historians began to lose belief in absolute 
truths, which had legitimized the social order so far. And it has led historians, 
social scientists and literary theorists to dismantle frontiers and think other ways of doing 
research in humanities and social sciences.

Hayden White in Tropics of Discourse argues that many contemporary historians no
longer agree that art and sciences are essentially separate ways of understanding the world. 
> “Today it seems quite clear that the nineteenth-century belief in the radical dissimilarity 
>between art and science resulted from a misunderstanding fostered by the romantic artist's 
fear of science and the positivist scientist's ignorance of art.” (40-41)

In The Order of Things, published in 1966, Foucault challenges the binary
opposition reality/imagination or science/art by doing a lengthy discussion of Las Meninas, a painting by the Spanish painter 
Diego Velazquez. In Las Meninas, Velazquez uses the light to play with complex gazes by 
concealing the most important subject of the painting. In his analysis, 
Foucault develops his central argument: all periods of history
have some fundamental conditions to define what is acceptable as truth in scientific discourses. While some discourses have been considered truthful and valid, others can be taken as witchcraft, magic, or heresy. 


Furthermore, Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse change over time through
general and relative changes in the episteme from one period to another. In his analysis 
of Las Meninas, he is interested in finding another way of looking. For him, the 
painting represents conflicting viewpoints, multiple foci, on the relationship between 
art and reality that involves our own gaze as we put ourselves into the abyss. 

The presence of the painter in his object of art as well as the looking glass with the
reflection of the couple makes the observer think about what is 
central and what is at the margins for the painter. For Foucault, 
Velazquez reverses the subject/object positions, destabilizing the 
subject which loses his fixity. By deconstructing the subject, Foucault questions the very idea of truth, 
essential to the foundation of sciences.

Though in the last decades of twentieth century, not only 
Foucault challenged scientific paradigms, but a large number 
of historians no longer believed in the science/art, truth/imagination dichotomies,
however; some of them stuck to old conceptions, 
“committed to the search for the elusive document that will establish 
them as an authority in a narrowly defined field ...” (41) 


Behind this search for the truth from a supposedly
neutral interpretation of the facts, historians often disseminated stereotypes, reinforcing prejudices and contributing to the exclusion of the various Others from their historical narratives. 
For such historians, what matters most 
is the veracity of the facts, so “they forget to take into account
that the facts are just versions of the facts; that their description usually involves a constant and immediate interpretation, and that this interpretation is often embedded with prejudices of race, class, gender.” (Delacastagne, 2001) 


It is not the real or any attachment to reality that directs this research,
but this work envisages possibilities of taking another look at history, 
in order to unveil and reconstruct the histories of those who 
were often excluded from the Official History. And the narratives 
written by women from African nations have given us this possibility 
of exploring their history through another perspective. It should not
be unusual to utilize fictional works to investigate African women’s history for black
communities have always used narratives, proverbs, songs to theorize and reflect upon reality. 

Therefore, these literary narratives deal with the authoritarianism of
African patriarchy, the interference of colonialism and neo-colonialism
in women’s lives. Women writers subvert and challenge colonial and 
patriarchal institutions, focusing on the feminine place in their 
communities, while informing us of the existence of a different place
from those who are part of the representations that populate history books,
literary works, scientific discourses and our imagination.

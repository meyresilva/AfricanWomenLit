## Stereotypical Images in Conrad's Heart of Darkness



In 1898 Joseph Conrad published Heart of
Darkness, a novel that would become a landmark for colonial studies. The novel emerged
from Conrad’s travels to what was the Belgian colony, Congo, which served as his main
inspiration. Though the novel has been acknowledged as a critique of King Leopold’s
abuses in Africa, Conrad also portrays a darkness of the continent and an African people
deprived of humanity, as the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe remarked almost sixty years
later (Achebe 1977).


In many ways, colonized women’s bodies needed to be under control as they represented
a danger to social order, thus stereotypical images of depraved women have long been
part of Western imagination. In many ways, colonial history has been written on female
bodies that often serve as the metaphor for the conquered land, an untamed space that
must be regulated. Like native lands, female bodies become properties of a patriarchal
colonial system.

In Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Marlow, the narrator, describes the apparition of a native woman who disturbs him. For Marlow, the woman appears to be as mythical and frightening as Africa, thus embodying what is unknown and obscure as the mass of land itself. While Marlow contemplates the woman, he thinks about Africa as “the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the colossal body that look at her, pensive as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous soul” (Conrad 132). For the narrator, the woman and the mass of land are equated. Both of them bear an emptiness
and darkness that are almost palpable, and both of them are under the European male gaze as objects of desire. 

Through Marlow’s narration, the native woman is gradually dehumanized, her body appropriated by his language and discourse that seeks to define the unknown. Narratives like Conrad’s Heart of Darkness not only invent Africa for European and for native people, but they also disseminate the image of a lascivious and fearful native woman who must fulfill colonial desires. Through discourse, the whitemale subject creates and objectifies the native woman who becomes the embodiment of an untamed blank space, a space that gradually takes form through Marlow’s narrative.
European cultural texts have historically constructed African sexualities as dirty
and impure. In this sense, Christianity and colonization have linked African female sexuality to danger, violence, or death, and “to the missions, excessive African sexuality was to be restrained as a salient element of their ‘civilizing mission’ project” (Becker 37).

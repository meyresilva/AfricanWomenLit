## Female Bodies and Colonial Narratives

<p> 
Female bodies played an important role in defining the emptiness of colonized territories,
and, in many colonial narratives, they were treated as synonymous with colonized land. 
One of the notions spread by European colonialism on the African continent was the myth of 
the “virgin land” that implies a blank territory in which colonized populations
“cannot claim aboriginal territorial rights, and white male patrimony is violently 
assured as the sexual military insemination of an interior void” (McClintock 30). </p>


Metaphors of the colonized land as a woman ready to be deflowered have been part of colonial 
discourses around the globe. As a virgin, a woman is dispossessed of sexual desire and agency, 
becoming embedded in patriarchal tales of male sexual fantasy, the land also turns into a site for the male colonizer’s most perverted desires.  

> As, McClintock affirms, women becomethe earth to
be discovered, entered, named, inseminated, and above all, owned *(McClintock 31)*.

During the nineteenth century sexuality and race functioned as prominent markers
of Otherness, setting parameters for what was normal and acceptable and what must be
regulated and brought into normality. In 1898 Joseph Conrad published <i>Heart of
Darkness</i>, a novel that would become a landmark for colonial studies. The novel emerged
from Conrad’s travels to what was the Belgian colony, Congo, which served as his main
inspiration. Though the novel has been acknowledged as a critique of King Leopold’s
abuses in Africa, Conrad also portrays a darkness of the continent and an African people
deprived of humanity, as the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe remarked almost sixty years
later(Achebe 1977). </p>

To understand how these literary works undo stereotypes and reconstruct female subjectivity, it is crucial to see these narratives as a looking
glass where writers come to terms with their fragmented identities while giving their community tools to reinterpret women's experiences through
other lenses. </p>

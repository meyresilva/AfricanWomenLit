Werewere Liking (born 1950, in Cameroon) is a writer, 
playwright and performer. Her main work *Elle sera de jasper et de corail* 
uses stylistic innovation, challenging literary genres, 
thus playing with semantics, and morphology to propose a
 recovery of women’s voices through poetics, aesthetics and imagination. 
The text aligns with a broader movement for women empowerment, 
very present in the post-independence discourses across the African countries.
 The Cameroonian writer, through her multiple narrators, 
discusses women’s condition in her country but refuses to 
utilize Western epistemology, thus creating the neologism *misovire*, 
which literally means male hater, for her narrator. 


 Liking’s *misovire* uses the power of
 imagination to create, through the literary,
 a place which subverts the dichotomies by challenging 
paradigms which have determined our ways of thinking and 
conceptualizing. Through her message, the *misovire* demands
 gender equity through her textual liberation and experimentation.
 The author imagines a new world that blurs gender, racial, social,
 religious and national barriers. By placing at the center of her writing, 
the literary text itself, the writer mixes poetry, manifesto, 
novel and theatre while envisaging a space that permits freedom from patriarchal 
norms and colonial language. 
 
 
Werewere Liking defines her work as a chant- roman
 or a journal that contains nine sections or chapters.
 Each chapter deals with a different aspect of her project: the creation of a
 new humanity made of jasper and coral that overcomes the dichotomies 
created during the colonial period, either black/ white, or colonized/colonizer,
 thus proposing other ways of thinking of theorizing. 


For the *misovire*, if our episteme has been tainted and our 
way of conceptualizing has been determined by a historical past,
 her proposal of using art to create what she calls a “new race.”
 In her poetics, structures and paradigms give place 
to colors blended almost in a synesthetic way  
as the text gradually gives place to a human being 
who inhabits a created land which she calls Lunai.


While creating the new human and the place she inhabits, firstly, 
the writer experiments a
 textual liberation that disconnects her creative writing from western impositions. 
Breaking up with genre conventions in this work means not only a 
form to express the controversies of approaching Africa
 through Western literary conventions, but also a strategy
 to create new discourses. Within a tension which 
reflects the process of creation, 
*Elle sera de jaspe et de coral*, 
through metalinguistics, attempts to explain itself.

Ken Bugul's *Le baobab fou*


>Ken Bugul (born 1947 in Ndoucoumane) is the pen name of Senegalese novelist Mariètou Mbaye. The editors of Nouvelle Éditions Africaines,
>a major publishing house in Senegal advised Marietou M’Baye to publish her story under a pen name because her autobiography 
>included revelations that could scandalize the audience in her country. 

*Le Baobab Fou* is scandalous not only because the female narrator exposes her body and her sexual desires, but also because it makes the reader reflect upon the ways that colonization have affected women living in independent African countries. To publish her story, Marietou M’Baye chose the pseudonym Ken Bugul, a Wolof expression that means “nobody wants it.”
Ken Bugul is generally a name given to a baby who comes after several miscarriages. Giving this name is a traditional way for parents to protect
their babies from death, a way to tell the world that nobody wants the newborn, not even God. 
By adopting the pseudonym Ken Bugul, Marietou M`Baye is attempting to ensure survival and avoid death. The pseudonym protects the author while revealing her agency.

>Becoming Ken Bugul was like a rebirth. I could then continue to live thereafter.
>Had I not become Ken Bugul, I would have ceased to exist … I was in a critical
>phase of my life in which I had to write or I would die. (Ken Bugul, in Interview
>with de Larquier 319 )

Today African women writers as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie have been part and parcel of our academic studies, youtube search, and entertainment. Everybody has heard Adichie talking about feminisms, her life as a Nigerian woman or her experience as a migrant in the US. Most of us read *Purple Hibiscus*, *Half of a Yellow Sun* or any other of her works, however, a few of us listened to Adichie acknowledging African writers and feminists who inspired her work as Ama Ata Aidoo, Emechetta, and others. 

Here, I will introduce some writers who started publishing in the seventies or sixties, ama Ata Aidoo. Works authored by these women often deal with the authoritarianism of African patriarchy, 
the interference of colonialism and neo-colonialism in womenâ€™s lives. These writers subvert 
and challenge colonial and patriarchal institutions, focusing on their communities, 
while dismantling the representations that still, even with Adichie around, populate history books, literary works, scientific discourses and our imagination.

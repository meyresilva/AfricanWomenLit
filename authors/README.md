## Introduction

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's texts have been part and parcel of what we call pop culture. Everybody has heard Adichie talking about feminisms, her life as a Nigerian woman or her experience as a migrant in the US, her friendship with the pop star Beyoncé. Most of us read *Purple Hibiscus*, *Half of a Yellow Sun* or watched her talks on feminisms, however, a few of us listened to Adichie acknowledging African writers and feminists who inspired her work as Ama Ata Aidoo, Emechetta, and others. 

Here, I will introduce some writers who started publishing in the seventies or sixties. Their works often deal with the authoritarianism of African patriarchy, 
the interference of colonialism and neo-colonialism in women’s lives, women's condition in African nations. These writers subvert 
and challenge colonial and patriarchal institutions, focusing on their communities 
while dismantling the representations that still, even with Adichie around, populate history books, literary works, scientific discourses and our imagination.

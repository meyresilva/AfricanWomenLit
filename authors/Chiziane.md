> For me writing is a way of being in the world. I need my space, so I write. First, I
> write to exist, I write for me. I exist in the world and my existence is repeated in
other people. (Chiziane)



Paulina Chiziane published Niketche: Uma Historia de Poligamia (A Story of
Polygamy) in 2002, eight years after Mozambique's democratic elections. She is the first Mozambican female novelist and one of Africa’s most prominent writers. Born in southern Mozambique in the province of Gaza, Chiziane was six years old when her family moved to the capital city of Lourenço Marques. Though she grew up in a Protestant family, Chiziane attended a Catholic mission school where she learned Portuguese. Besides Chope, her native language learned from her parents and community, she also learned Tonga while living in the colonial capital. She pursued higher education at University Eduardo Mondlane and became a political activist for the socialist party Fremilo, an experience that certainly had a great impact on her literary
work.

Besides Niketche (2002), Chiziane also published five other novels: Balada de Amor ao Vento [Love Songs in the Wind] in 1990, Ventos do Apocalipse [Winds of Apocalypse] in 1993, O Setimo Juramento [The Seventh Oath] in 2000, and O Alegre canto da Perdiz [The Joyous Song of Partridge] in 2008.

Chiziane’s Niketche: A Story of Polygamy unveils how colonial and nationalist
policies have shaped Mozambican women's experience. The novel not only addresses the ways that women challenge the fallacy of the nationalist project and its impact on women’s lives, but it reveals how women’s desire disturbs the social order. Female desire becomes a catalyst to destabilize patriarchal power, while the celebration of women’s sexuality turns into an instrument for subjectivity construction.

Chiziane’s narrative reinvents cultural traditions, creating a space for women to decide which aspects of traditional practices they want to retain. In coming to terms with continuity and change in postcolonial Mozambique, Niketche re-imagines the national by restoring women’s
voices.

## Introduction

In this repository I will share my research on gender and sexuality in African women's narratives, including my doctoral dissertation and articles published in peer-reviewed journals. To start working on literature authored by African women or women from the global south, it is crucial to get familiar with theory, however, reading theoretical texts, especially on gender might be tough and quite challenging, even for those who enjoy it, as they often present 
an almost impenetrable language and a multi-disciplinary approach that encompasses a diverse and wide terrain.  

Having said that, I intend to design a roadmap here for those who want to start doing research on gender and sexuality in Africa or in any other region, especially from the global south. First, I introduce theory, focusing on the ways in which some literary critics such as Terry Eagleton, Gayatri Spivak, Firdous Azim, and Anne McClintock examine hegemonic discourses in literature and cultural production. Also, I include a theoretical approach on feminisms highlights diverse perspectives on women's condition in African nations or other developing countries, usually not part of the global north.

Also, Some selected works authored by African women from several nations give an idea
of the main themes in these narratives.

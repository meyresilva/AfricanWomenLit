## Introduction

In this repository I will share my research on gender and sexuality in African women's narratives, including my doctoral dissertation and articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Here, I intend to design a roadmap here for those who want to start doing research on gender and sexuality in Africa or in any other region, especially in the global south. I introduce theory, focusing on the ways in which some literary critics such as Terry Eagleton, Gayatri Spivak, Firdous Azim, and Anne McClintock examine hegemonic discourses in literature and cultural production. 

It is crucial to understand theory, however, reading theoretical texts, especially on gender might be tough and quite challenging, even for those who enjoy it, as they often present an almost impenetrable language 
and a multi-disciplinary approach that
encompasses a diverse and wide terrain, thus cutting the ground is an important step to get familiar with language and terminology.

Finally, I explore some works authored by African women from several nations, pointing out
the main themes in their narratives.

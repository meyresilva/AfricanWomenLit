## Introduction

In this repository I will some topics on African Women's literature, including some theoretical framework I used to write my doctoral dissertation and peer-reviewed articles. To start studying works authored by African women or women from the global south, it is crucial to get familiar with theory.

Theoretical texts, especially on Gender Studies and Postcolonial Theory often present
an almost impenetrable language. Thus, reading Gayatry Spivak, bell hooks, anne McClintock might give a hard time for anyone,  
even for those who enjoy theory, as I do.

Having said that, I will start giving a roadmap for those who want to start doing research on this field. First, I will present a critique on colonialist and nationalist discourses, often present in works authored by African Women, as you see here .....

Also, I will give an example of colonialist narrative in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, as in this text...


In the end, I will present some Postcolonial feminist theory, as you find here.

## Gender and Sexuality in Works Authored by African Women

Colonial narratives and nationalist rhetoric in Africa have always associated
female sexuality with male desire and consumption, aberrance or perversion. While colonial discourses suggested that native women’s bodies should be tamed and possessed, nationalist narratives usually equated female bodies with land, nature, and spirituality. In different ways, hegemonic discourses appropriate the female body and sexuality to convey ideologies concerning the conquest of distant lands
or related to the dignity of a national community. 

<p>I examine how African
women writers’ representation of female desire counternarrates colonialist and nationalist
tales while disturbing gender conventions and defying social norms in African contexts. Works authored by African women often 
reveal female sexuality, while simultaneously subverting discourses that often define female bodies as sexual
objects or as spiritual entities— as the Mother Africa, a trope widespread in the speeches
of the Negritude movement.</p> 


<p>  
These works demonstrate not only the consequences of several policies and idologies on women’s bodies and minds but also reveal the exclusion of women’s voices from national and political affairs. By reinventing the literary in
order to forge a medium that is able to give sense to African women’s experience, women's works confront history and interrogate
the role of literature and the work of art.</p>

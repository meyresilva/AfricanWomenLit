## Introduction

In this repository I will present some topics on African women's literature, including some theoretical framework I used to write my doctoral dissertation and peer-reviewed articles. To start studying works authored by African women or women from the global south, it is crucial to get familiar with theory.

Reading Gayatry Spivak, bell hooks, anne McClintock might give us a hard time, as theoretical texts, especially on Gender Studies and Postcolonial Theory often present
an almost impenetrable language. 

Having said that, I will start giving a roadmap for those who want to start doing research on this field. First, a critique on colonialist and nationalist discourses, often present in works authored by African Women, as you see here .....

Also, Some examples of colonialist and nationalist discourses in Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* and Chinua Achebe's *Things Fall Apart* as in these samples.... 



In the end, I will present some theory on gender, black women and postcolonial Feminist theories, as you find here.
